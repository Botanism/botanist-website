Now that you have improve our bot you have to publish what you did! For that you have to make a Pull Request (PR), it's like a proposition.

Please respect the [Rules](#Rules) and then your improvement will be quickly accepted! :smile:

You have to commit what you've done to your forked repository (on **your** GitHub account), and  then when it's done to push them.

After that you have to make a PR, for that you can use a client (e.g. GitKraken, SublimeMerge) or do it directly from the GitHub website. Go on the forked repo (e.g. https://github.com/YOUR_NAME/Botanist) and then go to the "Pull Requests" tab (between Code and Projects). Now click on "New Pull Request", select `s0lst1ce/Botanist` for the "base repository" and your repo for the "head repository". *For both ones, select the right branch.*

Then you can submit your PR, after that we will review your PR to avoid conflicts. It may take few days, please be patient, we'll always seriously consider any submission :wink:
