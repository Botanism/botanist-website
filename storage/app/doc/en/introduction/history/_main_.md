I ([@s0lst1ce](https://github.com/s0lst1ce)) started building this bot at the end of April 2019 using discord.py API. This bot was first made with the intent to make my discord server more powerful and alive. I had only created it a few days ago but I had realized that I would need additional tools to be able to fulfill all of the plans I had for this server. I had already started making a [bot](https://github.com/organic-bots/LazyFactorian) which serves as an interface to factorio's resources. I thus started building a bot that would enable me to easily manage a scalable server which would contain all of my future bots and would serve as a platform for all my creations.

   After the very first version I got some help of a friend of mine. Together we made the bot evolve so that it could join the ranks of other servers. Indeed I had started to realize that the bot, however simple, may be useful to others. He built the the Todo extension. After that I kind of set back from the project.

   After a month or two I got back to it with the idea to simplify the code base. The first thing on my list was the Config entry which was very hard to work with and hacky. So I built it in a more modular way so that it would be easier to maintain, expend, open up the way for i18n and ease expansion.

   Once that was done I pondered a while on how to re-word the help system. Failing to find a good solution I rather got on that task of implementing more functionalities, better document commands, fix bugs and enhance the look of the commands outputs. All this made the bot a much more robust product I am now proud to share.

   Still translations were still unsupported and the help system as unpractical. Because of this I forced myself to try both of these although I had no great idea on how to implement them. Translations were easier to introduce than I thought and I now have people working on actually writing them. As for the help system it has been enhanced already and more is on the way!
